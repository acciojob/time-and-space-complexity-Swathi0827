	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, usually measured in terms of the size of the input. The efficient of time complexities is accessing an array by index.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses, usually measured in terms of size of the input. O(n) is used to linear space complexity. </p>
